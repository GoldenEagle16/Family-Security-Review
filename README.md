# Family Security and Privacy Review
Every six months I walk my family, roommates, and friends through a security and privacy review. Also it serves as a conversation regarding its importance and a sharing of news, rumors, and new concerns. Here is what is on my checklist:

### Privacy

- [ ] Change all device names to something else
- [ ] Set up connecting devices to generate random MAC addresses when connecting to WiFi
- [ ] Make sure no apps can access google emails or google drive
- [ ] Make sure no app tokens have been generated on dropbox/box/mega/onedrive accounts
- [ ] Make sure no app tokens have been generated on twitter/facebook/github accounts
- [ ] With a fresh device, on a never used wifi, do a google search for each other's names and handles, share findings
- [ ] Ensure phones have disk encryption enabled
- [ ] Ensure computing devices have disk encryption enabled
- [ ] Perform CloudFlare's Browsing Experience Security Check
- [ ] Consider using encrypted-sni
- [ ] Review the cost/benefit of disabling what'sApp backups
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13BahrdkMU8
- [ ] Google for any leaks of your biometric information
- [ ] Use a browser that is NOT Chrome, or Edge. Suggestions include Brave Browser, Waterfox, and Firefox

- [ ] If using Firefox, Use Facebook Continers extension by Mozilla (The creators of firefox)
- [ ] Turn off personalized ads on Google Products

### Security

- [ ] Make sure 2fa is enabled for all financial, social, and critical sites
- [ ] Make sure 2fa does not use Text message (SMS)
- [ ] Make a list of all financial/401k/HSA/retirement/investment/loan Accounts
- [ ] Make sure financial accounts have correct mailing address
- [ ] Make sure USPS mail forwarding is renewed on any previous residences

We need to talk about security and privacy in order to share tips and tricks and discuss how effective they are. I hope this list helps. Please open an issue ticket with updates or suggestions.
