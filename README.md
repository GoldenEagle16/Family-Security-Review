# Family Security and Privacy Review
Every six months I walk my family, roommates, and friends through a security and privacy review. Also it serves as a conversation regarding its importance and a sharing of news, rumors, and new concerns. Here is what is on my checklist:

### Privacy

- [ ] Change all device names to something else
- [ ] Set up connecting devices to generate random MAC addresses when connecting to WiFi
- [ ] Make sure no apps can access google emails or google drive
- [ ] Make sure no app tokens have been generated on dropbox/box/mega/onedrive accounts
- [ ] Make sure no app tokens have been generated on any reddit/twitter/facebook/github accounts
- [ ] With a fresh device, on a never used wifi, do a google search for each other's names and handles, share findings
- [ ] Ensure phones have disk encryption enabled
- [ ] Ensure computing devices have disk encryption enabled
- [ ] Perform CloudFlare's Browsing Experience Security Check
- [ ] Consider using encrypted-sni
- [ ] Review the cost/benefit of disabling what'sApp backups
- [ ] Google for any leaks of your biometric information
- [ ] Use a browser that is NOT Chrome, or Edge. Suggestions include Brave Browser, Waterfox, and Firefox
- [ ] If using Firefox, Use Firefox Monitor
- [ ] If using Firefox, Use Facebook Continers extension by Mozilla (The creators of firefox)
- [ ] Turn off personalized ads on Google Products
- [ ] Turn off personalized ads on Windows 10
- [ ] Consider using an sms encryption app like Signal. Avoid using telegram or WhatsApp
- [ ] Opt-out of interest-based advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) at the DAA’s Choice Page, located at http://www.aboutads.info/choices

### Security

- [ ] Make sure 2fa is enabled for all your accounts. Especially any financial, social, and mission-critical sites
- [ ] Make sure 2fa does not use Text message (SMS). DuckDuckGo "ss7 protocol hack"
- [ ] Consider using a [YubiKey](https://security.stackexchange.com/q/17922/6402)
- [ ] Make a list of all financial/401k/HSA/retirement/investment/loan Accounts
- [ ] Walk through your account list and change your passwords
- [ ] Make sure financial accounts have correct mailing address
- [ ] Make sure USPS mail forwarding is renewed on any previous residences
- [ ] Review emergency contacts on phones
- [ ] Review emergency medical information on phones
- [ ] Review blocked numbers and contacts on phones
- [ ] Review blocked numbers and contacts on social media sites
- [ ] Create/review code words for each other
- [ ] Create/review code phrases for each other
- [ ] Create/review a cognitive key
- [ ] Review Yubikey usage
- [ ] Ensure all devices are still getting updates, without any issues. Note any devices or software that are no longer supported
- [ ] Review any Cryptocurrency wallets and balences
- [ ] Review your sms encryption app for zero days or bad press coverage
- [ ] Consider using keybase
- [ ] Review Computers for installed software induced vulnerabilities and backdoors. Remember: "Freeware is killware"
- [ ] Check https://haveibeenpwned.com/
- [ ] Review your choice of mesh network apps, to make sure they still can be trusted. A mesh network chat app can continue to work after your government has disabled internet
- [ ] Make sure your home router/modem has up-to-date firmware. Consider buying your own instead of leasing from your ISP
- [ ] Change your SSID name and password
- [ ] Unlink your e2e chat apps from other devices. Relink where approprate. i.e. web.whatsapp.com, signal app, telegram, keybase.io, etc

### Practices
- [ ] Keep a list of all the apps/software/sites you and your family uses or has accounts with
- [ ] In this list, flag which are closed-source
- [ ] In this list, flag which are developed in countries you do not trust
- [ ] Make it a happen to check the settings or preferences of any app you install or use
- [ ] After creating an account on a service or website check the settings. Look for privacy or security settings
- [ ] Consider being more intentional and stragetic with how you choose your passwords. [Consider the pros/cons of my password system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mBnwHLMqtHWdgvhLyzcLtfrguBWTmDJ4Libn90__fW8/edit?usp=sharing)

### Contingency
- [ ] Make sure all of your devices are backed up and secured
- [ ] Download a copy of your facebook @ facebook.com/download
- [ ] Download a copy of all data from your gmail account
- [ ] Pick a random site or service that you use. Imagine if you woke up one day with it all deleted. Prepare your next steps
- [ ] Plan for a sim swap attack against you or your family. Have a checklist prepared
- [ ] Plan for your house burning down. Would you still have all your passwords? Would you lose access to any crypto currencies?
- [ ] Consider putting your passwords and accounts in an encrypted file. Place this file inside an password protected archive folder. Give this archive to two of your trusted friends, but to each of them only one password. This can serve as a backup or deadman switch.
- [ ] Consider expanding a mesh network of your choice by running the software or hardware. Like [goTenna Mesh](https://imeshyou.gotennamesh.com/)

### Education

We need to talk about security and privacy in order to share tips and tricks and discuss how effective they are. I hope this list helps. Please open an issue ticket with updates or suggestions.
