# Family-Security-Review
Every six months I walk my family, roommates, and friends through a security and privacy review. Also it serves as a conversation regarding its importance and a sharing of news, rumors, and new concerns. Here is what is on my checklist:

### Privacy

- [ ] Change all device names to something else
- [ ] Set up connecting devices to generate random MAC addresses when connecting to WiFi
- [ ] Make sure no apps can access google emails or google drive
- [ ] Make sure no app tokens have been generated on dropbox/box/mega/onedrive accounts
- [ ] Make sure no app tokens have been generated on twitter/facebook/github accounts
- [ ] With a fresh device, on a never used wifi, do a google search for each other's names and handles, share findings
- [ ] Ensure phones have disk encryption enabled
- [ ] Ensure computing devices have disk encryption enabled
- [ ] Perform CloudFlare's Browsing Experience Security Check
- [ ] Consider using encrypted-sni
- [ ] Review the cost/benefit of disabling what'sApp backups

- [ ] Turn off personalized ads on Windows 10
- [ ] Opt-out of interest-based advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) at the DAA’s Choice Page, located at http://www.aboutads.info/choices





We need to talk about security and privacy in order to share tips and tricks and discuss how effective they are. I hope this list helps. Please open an issue ticket with updates or suggestions.
